<p>I want to archive some files from a specific folder and delete original files after the process complete. So the steps I wanted to do are:</p><p>O1: Define a number of days to keep original files, so all files within today -&gt; (today - N) will be kept</p><p>O2: Define a max number of days to be processed, so if there are lot of files in the folder then only oldest&nbsp;files of M days will be processed. This will help to save the server resources.</p><p>O3: Define a target place to save new archive files</p><p>For details, I will use powershell to find all files for O1. After 7z will be used to compress and test files - the O2. After all, Powershell will be used to delete original files already archived.</p><p><br></p>
