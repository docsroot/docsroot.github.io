<p>Have installed a build server using Jenkins &amp; MSBuild but having several issues. And below are the notes on how to fix them all.</p><p>1/&nbsp;".NETFramework,Version=v4.6" were not found<br></p><p>The action is to download and install package from here&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=48136">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=48136</a></p><p><br></p><p>2/ Missing&nbsp;Microsoft.WebApplication.targets</p><p>error MSB4019: The imported project "C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio\v14.0\WebApplications\Microsoft.WebApplication.targets" was not found. Confirm that the path in the &lt;Import&gt; declaration is correct, and that the file exists on disk.</p><p>So I have to copy the from development machine to the build server. The whole folder "C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio\v14.0" needs to be copied on build server.</p>
