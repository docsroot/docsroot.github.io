<p>In my application, I want to sort a list of objects by multiple aspects like the creation time / update time; number of views on it (how pupular it is); quality of content on it...</p><p>Below are options I <i>think</i> of for the sorting.</p><p>1/ Join multiple tables</p><p>If there are two or more tables, the sort can be done by joining tables for the query then order by one ore several fields</p><p>Disadvantage of this is the query becomes more complex for less value (just ordering) and performance could be impact</p><p>2/ Creating dedicated field / table for ordering</p><p>Maybe a new table contains of some fields like ObjectId (Type + Id), Order could be an option. But we need a background task to calculate and update the field.</p><p>Then the query can just join with one table to take the Order value</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
