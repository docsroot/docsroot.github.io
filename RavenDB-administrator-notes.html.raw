<p>* Restoration can't work in parallel (only one restore task)</p><p>* If we stop the server during a restoration, the status will be kept (go to studio to check restore progress before making a restart - if needed)</p><p>* If after restarted, it says another restore is inprogress, we must do: go to system database, delete the restore/status document, and restore/inprogress document</p><p><br></p>
