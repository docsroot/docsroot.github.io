<p>I have done several tasks that require to send email to clients, and each task has difference aspects. After all below is my notes for future reuse.</p><p><b>1/ To list (-To)</b></p><p>This accepts an array only, so it could be ONE email address or an array if multiple recipients will receive the mail.</p><p>If emails is a string line "address1@docsroot.com, other@docsroot.com", we must create an array like : $To = $addresses.Split(",")</p><p><b>2/ Attachments list (-Attachments)</b></p><p>This is an array also, we can build an array contains full path of files.</p><p>If any file that does not exist, it will raise an error.</p><p>To get all files within a folder, instead of looping to get full path, we can simply use:</p><blockquote><p>$attachments = Join-Path $mailDataRoot "*.csv"&nbsp;-Resolve</p></blockquote><p><b>3/ Unicode mail (subject or body)</b></p><p>When reading an Unicode file, we should pass -Encoding value, such as UTF8:</p><blockquote>$mailDataContent = Get-Content $mailDataFile -Encoding UTF8</blockquote><p>Then on Send-MailMessage function, also need to put an Encoding, but the value must be .Net type:</p><blockquote><p>... -Encoding ([System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8)</p></blockquote>
