<p>1/ AWS - Elastic IP (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/#Elastic_IP_Addresses">https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/#Elastic_IP_Addresses</a>)</p><p>When an instance does not have static IP, it will be assigned a random IP from the pool on each start.</p><p>We can reserve an IP with very low cost, it will be charged only if the instance mapped to it is off. So the price can be 0.005$ / hour (off).</p>
