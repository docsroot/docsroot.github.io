<p>I have done several tasks that require to send email to clients, and each task has difference aspects. After all below is my notes for future reuse.</p><p>1/ To list (-To)</p><p>This accepts an array only, so it could be ONE email address or an array if multiple recipients will receive the mail.</p><p>If emails is a string line "address1@docsroot.com, other@docsroot.com", we must create an array like : $To = $addresses.Split(",")</p><p>2/ Attachments list (-Attachments)</p><p>This is an array also, we can build an array contains full path of files.</p><p>If any file that does not exist, it will raise an error.</p><p>To get all files within a folder, instead of looping to get full path, we can simply use</p><blockquote>$attachments = Join-Path $mailDataRoot "*.csv"&nbsp;-Resolve</blockquote>
