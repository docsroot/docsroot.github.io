<p>The case my client met was that they can't access to admin account anymore because previous person left the company, his email is deleted. When other person try to make a reset, Moodle can't sent email.</p><p>So one of the solution is to reset password directly in database by an update sql but we must deal with hashing algorithment.</p><p>Other solution if we can access to config.php file is<br></p><p>* All database information are in config.php file, including server / db name / table prefix</p><p>* Also we can find what is admin account in $cfg -&gt; admin variable</p><p>* Perform a query to search for that account. If having it, we can update the password field to value of another working account.</p><p>* If not, we can update the email, with a check on other column emailstop must be 0</p><p>* Perform a reset password on UI, search by username if avoid the case of multiple accounts map to single email</p><p>* Check the mailbox and follow instructions sent by Moodle.</p>
